1. Encoders - 
2. GPS - Geo positioning systems - Location in the point on earth (x,y)(Latitude, Longitude, Altitude) and time
3. Degrees of Freedom (DOF) - Number of independent ways a mechanism can move. 
4. Kinematics - Study of motion of object without considering the force that produced the motion
5. Dynamics - Study of motion of object considerin the force that produced the motion
6. Forward Kinematics - Gives the position of the robots parts (Joints, end effector)
7. Inverse Kinematics - Given the target position finds the joint angle to move to the target location.
8. Modelling - Model the how all the components are interconnected in mathematial sense
9. Joint Angle - Angle formed at the joints between two components connected at the joint 
10. SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) - At the same time findig where you are (Localization) and map of the surrounding environment (Mapping). "Chicken and Egg Problem" - You need map to localize, to have map you need to know where you are (localize).
11. Haptic Interaction - The ability of users to physically feel and interact with objects in remote or virtual environments using data-gloves (tactile, forces).
12. Simulators - Mimic the behaviour of a system (Software)
13. Emulators - Replicate the entire system (Hardware and Software)
14. Early Robots - Honda P2, P3, ASIMO, SDR-4X, Qrio, HRP 2, Wabian,
