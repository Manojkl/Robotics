1. Encoders - 
2. GPS - Geo positioning systems - Location in the point on earth (x,y)(Latitude, Longitude, Altitude) and time
3. Degrees of Freedom (DOF) - Number of independent ways a mechanism can move. 
4. Kinematics -
5. Dynamics - 
6. Forward Kinematics - Gives the position of the robots parts (Joints, end effector)
7. Inverse Kinematics - Given the target position finds the joint angle to move to the target location.
8. Modelling - Model the how all the components are interconnected in mathematial sense
9. Joint Angle - Angle formed at the joints between two components connected at the joint
